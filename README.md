# Usage

#### Dependencies

* Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your project build.gradle:

    ```groovy
	    allprojects {
		    repositories {
			    ...
			    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		    }
	    }
    ``` 

    **or**
    
    If Android studio version is Arctic Fox then add it in your settings.gradle:

    ```groovy
	   dependencyResolutionManagement {
    		repositories {
        		...
        		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    		}
	   }
    ``` 
    
* Step 2. Add the dependency in your app module build.gradle:
    
    ```groovy
        dependencies {
            ...
            implementation 'com.github.Mindinventory:AutoHighlightTTS:X.X.X'
        }
    ``` 

### Implementation   

* Step 1. Initialization of the MiTextToSpeech inside your viewmodel :
    
  ```kotlin
  ...

     lateinit var instanceOfTTS: AutoHighlightTTSEngine

    init {
        initTTS(context)
    }

    private fun initTTS(context: Context): AutoHighlightTTSEngine {
        instanceOfTTS = AutoHighlightTTSEngine
            .getInstance()
            .init(context)
            .setLanguage(Locale.ENGLISH)
            .setPitchAndSpeed(1f, 1f)
            .setText(context.getString(R.string.text_to_speech_text))
        return instanceOfTTS
    }

  ... 
  ```

* Step 2. Add listeners and MITextToSpeechText inside your composable :
    
  ```kotlin
  ...
    
         var instanceOfTTS by remember {
            mutableStateOf<AutoHighlightTTSEngine?>(null)
        }

        LaunchedEffect(instanceOfTTS == null) {
            instanceOfTTS = viewModel.instanceOfTTS
        }
  
  ...

        // Listeners to get status

        tts.setOnCompletionListener {
            Log.e("TAG", "TTSScreen: Completed From Callback")
        }.setOnErrorListener {
            //Perform action for error
        }.setOnEachSentenceStartListener {
            Log.e("TAG", "TTSScreen: onEachSentenceStart is called")
        }


  ...

    // The composable function displays the text and helps us to highlight the currently spoken sentence.

        TTSComposable(
            tts = tts,
            textAlign = TextAlign.Center,
            fontFamily = fontFamily,
            fontWeight = FontWeight.ExtraLight,
            miTextHighlightBuilder = MITextHighlightBuilder(
                text = tts.mainText,
                tts.highlightTextPair.value,
                style = SpanStyle(
                      fontFamily = fontFamily,
                      color = Amaranth,
                      fontWeight = FontWeight.Bold,
                    )
                ),
            style = TextStyle(
                fontSize = 20.sp, color = Color.Black,
                lineHeight = 35.sp
            ),
        )

  ...

  ```
